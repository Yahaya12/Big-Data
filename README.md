# Big-Data

I set out to employ different techniques and methodologies to build a predictive model that would be able to predict which person based on their features such as age, race, origin where able to win the different types of awards, using the dataset. 

# The Jupiter notebook is composed of the following:


1)<p><b>DATA CLEANING</b></p>

2)**DATA EXPLORATION**

HYPOTHESIS: MOST OSCAR WINNERS ARE WHITE.

HYPOTHESIS: MOST OSCAR WINNERS ARE FROM USA.	

HYPOTHESIS: BEST DIRECTORS TEND TO BE OLDER THAN BEST ACTORS OR ACTRESSES	

3)**MODEL BUILDING**	-
